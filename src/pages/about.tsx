      <p>I'm finkrer, although my real name is Evgeny.</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to my site. Here I have a blog where I express my thoughts on
        various matters, as well as a diary of sorts, which is private (at least
        I hope so).
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now I'm mostly interested in web development. In particular,
        making this site is a hobby of mine which I enjoy a lot! Aside from
        that, I am a university student, and I play CTF from time to time.
      </p>

        In general, I also enjoy history, computer games, reading fantasy,
        listening to music few people around me like, swimming and going on long
        rides on my bike. Also, I like knowing a little bit about everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        There isn't necessarily a lot to see here right now, but the site is
        fully functional and there will be more.
